XenoKit is an tool that can preview and edit many aspects of skills and characters in Xenoverse 2. It features a 3D viewport where changes can be made and viewed in real time.

This is an ALPHA release. Expect stuff to break. I would strongly suggest only using XenoKit on a fresh data folder, or to make a backup!

*****************************************************
Building
*****************************************************
You must have the main project (https://github.com/LazyBone152/XV2-Tools) at the same directory level when building, since XenoKit relies on it.

You will also need to manually place the Shaders in the build folder (you can get it from a release build)
